# **Some notes on how to use the version C5 and C6**
## **Warning**
Version  C5 and C6 only works with Sturdy Bunny or coming soon V2.
<p>
At this moment, the only version available is the trap release by magnet. When the software will be available, the 3 positions servo will be released.
<p>

## <center>For best results, be sure to use **N52 Magnets** on the encoder and the top of the filament exit. Secure the magnets in the encoder with a drop of glue, otherwise they will pop out when they are above the gate magnet.</center>


## **What to print for Revision C5 ?**

  * print the **Triple_Decky_Base_C5_3.stl** 
  * print **Triple_Decky_Filament_Path_With_Magnet_C5_3.stl** from the folder Filament_Path_with_magnets.
  * print the multicolor **Triple_Decky_Tag_Plates_X.stl** from the **Base_Tag_Plates** folder for the Triple_Decky_Base
  * print the tophat : **[a]Triple_Decky_Tophat_Integrated_For_Magnet_C5_3.stl**.
  * print the latch **[a]Triple_Decky_Latch_Beta3_1.stl**
  * print the trap of your choice from the Trap_Style folder. Experiment to find the one that gives the better holding capability.
    *  **TD_Base_Trap_C5_Round.stl**
    *  **TD_Base_Trap_C5_Screw.stl** (This one needs a set screw M3x3)
    *  **TD_Base_Trap_C5_V-Shape.stl**<p>

## **What to print for Revision C6 ?**

  * print the **Triple_Decky_Base_C6_0.stl** 
  * print **Triple_Decky_Filament_Path_For_Magnet_C6_2.stl** from the folder Filament_Path_with_magnets.
  * print the multicolor **Triple_Decky_Tag_Plates_X.stl** from the **Base_Tag_Plates** folder for the Triple_Decky_Base
  * print the tophat : **[a]Triple_Decky_Tophat-Integrated_For_Magnet_C6_2.stl**.
  * print the latch **[a]Triple_Decky_Latch_Beta3_1.stl**
  * print the trap of your choice from the Trap_Style folder. Experiment to find the one that gives the better holding capability.
    *  **TD_Base_Trap_C5_Round.stl**
    *  **TD_Base_Trap_C5_Screw.stl** (This one needs a set screw M3x3)
    *  **TD_Base_Trap_C5_V-Shape.stl**<p>
