# Important note about Filament Path

## **Some people have experienced the Filament_Path cracking when inserting the ECAS. To avoid that version B3.3 has a ECAS hole size 0.15mm wider than the original size. All other version prior and after B3.3 have all the original size.** 

## **If your printer is perfectly dialed in, DO NOT USE version B3.3, use B3.2 instead or the new B4.1 in Rev_B4 directory**

Only the print orientation of the ECAS hole is different from Sturdy Bunny. It is turn 90Â° for better printing and match with the original orientation of V1.1 from Ette.
