# Triple-Decky

## New triple deck filament block for ERCF V1 and Sturdy Bunny

Triple Decky is a replacment for the filament block on ERCF V1 and Sturdy Bunny. Its goal is to avoid the filament to move in or out the filament block while loading or unloading another gate.

To do that, the filament block consist in 2 parts (decks), that are kept appart by magnets. The filament is lifted by 1mm from the bottom BMG gear.

The top hat come on top of the 2nd deck and has the top BMG gear as before. 

Although the current version still has the possibility to ibstall the magnetic gate, it is normally not needed anymore.

## Versions

At this moment, there are 2 versions of Triple-Decky.

* for the original version of ERCF that is build with M5 all threaded rod.
* for the Sturdy Bunny that is build on a 2020 extrusion.
