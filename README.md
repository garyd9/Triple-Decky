# **Triple-Decky**

## New triple deck filament block for ERCF V1 and Sturdy Bunny

Triple Decky is a replacement for the filament block on ERCF V1 and Sturdy Bunny. Its goal is to avoid the filament to move in or out the filament block while loading or unloading another gate.

To do that, the filament block consist in 2 hinged parts (decks), that are kept apart by magnets. The filament is lifted by 1mm from the bottom BMG gear.

The top hat come on top of the 2nd deck and has the top BMG gear as before. 

Although the current version still has the possibility to install the magnetic gate, it is normally not needed anymore.

## **In Beta testing :**
* **Version C.** (Experimental, Coming soon)
  *  It will have a kind of brake to press against the filament when the gate is not selected. The exit side of the filament path can lift up about 0.5mm, enough to make the filament touching the brake part (trap). To release the brake it will use either :
     *  with a magnet that will be pushed back by the encoder magnet
     *  by using a special tophat that will need a 3rd position of the servo to be able to move the selector. (not available yet : software in development)<p>
  * The brake part will be easily replaceable in case it breaks.
  *  The multicolor tag plates will be the same for input and output side. (Same as in version B4 Base)<p>
  *  The use of the old magnetic gates will be impossible on that version.<p>
## **Yet in development :**
* **ERCF V2 :** at this moment, ERCF V2 is in development by a team of designers. Lots of things have been developed and are tested, but regarding the filament blocks, no decision have been taken on which version of Triple Decky or another type will be used.

    * ### **Triple Decky for Sturdy Bunny Rev. B4**
      * The output side of the filament path has been tilted by 4° to avoid rubbing on the encoder when the selector is moving.
      * The input side tag plate is rotated 90° for better printing without support.
      * New multicolor tag plates for 12 carts on the input side.
      * New multicolor gate plates for 12 carts on the output side to replace the magnetic gate. 
      * New integrated tophat based on number 1 tophat locker to be used with Springy [from Moggieuk](https://github.com/moggieuk/ERCF-Springy/tree/main)  
      * optional base to use the old magnetic gates. In that case, the small part of the hinge of the filament path must be cut at the mark.

    * ### Triple Decky for Sturdy Bunny Rev. B2 / B3
      This is the fisrt release

 *  ## For ERCF V1 / V1.1
   This is for the original design that is build with M5 all threaded rod. This version will not be developed further because almost all users / builders are moving to Sturdy Bunny, or the coming (soon) ERCF V2.
